                    	<p> Although financial education is not a required component of the school curriculum, it is one of the most important skills to have as a student. It is crucial in helping you understand key aspects of business, find a job, save for your retirement, or even to support yourself independently after graduating from high school. You will gain invaluable skills with Target Alpha that will be undoubtedly be used in any career that you wish to pursue. </p>

We provide all Target Alpha chapters with a school start-up package, an exclusive curriculum to help you guide your lesson plans, and any other guidance you may need. </p>

                    	<p> The word “Alpha” is a commonly used word in finance to describe returns that exceed the general market. “Target” can be viewed as a goal that one sets out to achieve. When combining the two, we can translate the two words into, "Our goal is to achieve above average returns." </p>
