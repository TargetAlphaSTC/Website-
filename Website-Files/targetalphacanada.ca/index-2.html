                	<p> The Target Alpha 2016 inter-school stock trading competition will run from October 27th, 9:30AM EST to February 20th, 4:00PM EST, as in accordance with the TSX on StockTrak. Each school competing in the competition will be allowed one portfolio for school chapter. Member participation is mandatory; Target Alpha suggests splitting larger clubs into industry specific “pods” to make pitches to the executive each week for investment ideas. Ultimately, the responsibility (as well as the username and password) of the portfolio lies in the one selected executive; this cannot be a member of the Target Alpha National Executive or Provincial Executive. </p>
